Decision Tree Using Scikit-Learn
This repository provides implementations and examples of decision trees using scikit-learn in Python. Decision trees are versatile models used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning. Here, you'll find practical demonstrations on how to build, visualize, and optimize decision tree models, along with explanations of key concepts such as tree pruning, feature importance, and hyperparameter tuning. Whether you're new to decision trees or looking to deepen your understanding, this repository aims to provide clear, accessible examples to help you leverage decision trees effectively in your machine learning projects.
